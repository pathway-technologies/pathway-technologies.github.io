One of the first steps we take with a new customer is to perform a DevOps health check. The DevOps transformation is a journey, and our customers need to answer two key questions:

- Where are you now?
- Where do you want to go?

# Where Are You Now?

Pathway Technologies will help you answer this question with an analysis of the practices that are already in place. The steps involved in turning a requirement or a change request into delivered product are traced, as it makes its way through development, test and operations. We seek to identify bottlenecks and delays in the pipeline, to see what can be changed to improve the process. We always listen first and speak second, identifying the customer’s pain points before making recommendations.

# Where Do You Want To Go?

It is important to have a clear business plan for a DevOps transformation. What business impact are you striving for? DevOps is commonly cited as a way to increase speed, but it can also be used to bring improvements to quality and customer satisfaction. We will identify measurable goals in the DevOps transformation, ensuring that the whole company is on board with the changes, from management to developer.

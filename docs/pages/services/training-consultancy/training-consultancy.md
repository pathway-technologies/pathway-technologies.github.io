## Your Software Compliance and Security Solutions Partner 

Pathway Technologies Ltd. provides leading-edge consulting to companies 
working in highly-regulated industries, where strict compliance to 
International Standards is required. We guide our customers along two 
parallel tracks: 

- We provide training to instil in your company a culture of safety and an 
understanding of the required standards. 

- We provide consulting to assist your company to be compliant, answering 
the "how" question. 

We are experts in Functional Safety (FuSa), from the generic FuSa standard (IEC 61508) to the 
Automotive (ISO 26262), Machinery Control (ISO 13849 and IEC 62061) and many other 
standards. We assist companies to develop products according to International Cybersecurity 
Standards (ISO 21434). We ensure that the specific challenges of artificial intelligence in a safety 
product are understood and implemented (ISO 21448).

Dr. Peter Wilks is a subject matter expert and trainer, and an approved 
instructor with TÜV SÜD Academy[^1]. All training is given under the Academy, 
ensuring the highest quality training experience. Subsequent consulting will 
then be tailored to your specific needs, maintaining a clear distinction 
between the training days and consultation.

Our unique approach, combining training and consultancy, ensures that all 
participants have the necessary skills for product compliance. In this we are 
partnering with Emenda to provide mature, customised solutions to our 
customers.
